// Commentary:
//
// This model demonstrates an integer range, as well as the effect of an
// interface constraint on the behavior of a component.
//
// Code:

interface icount
{
  in void up();
  in void down();

  behavior
  {
    subint Range {0..10};
    Range i = 5;
    [i < 10] on up: i = i + 1;
    [0 < i] on down: i = i - 1;
  }
}

component range
{
  provides icount count;

  behavior
  {
    on count.up(): {}
    on count.down(): {}
  }
}
